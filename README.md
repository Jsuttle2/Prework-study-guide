# Prework-study-guide

## Description


This is the initial prework for the UNCC Coding Bootcamp. Its purpose is to get new students acclimated to the kind of material they will be learning throughout the course.
It was created to provide a foundation for the upcoming lessons and was built in order to help ensure students are ready for the more complex problems to come.
It allows students to "hit the ground running" and acclimate to a fast paced learning environment.
This acted as a fantastic re-entry for me to shake off the rust after having not coded for so long.

Additionally a user can access the functional JavaScript through the DevTools console. It is recommended to inspect the page and use the console to view the various elements of code to get an idea of how everything fits together to create a functional whole.
